--Archaeological Sites Notes

--25 Turn
local PDStr25 = "Hierankonpolis[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Hieranokpolis is the largest site from the Predynastic period. Before Egypt became a kingdom, Hierakonpolis was a growing city on the Nile, consisting a large number of neighborhoods. A number of archaeological sites have been excavated at Hierakonpolis.[NEWLINE]    The site of Hierakonpolis was first explored in 1798 by Vivant Denon, a member of the Napoleonic Expedition to Egypt. However, it wasn¡¯t until 1887 that the archaeological extent of the city was recognized. The first archaeological research was started then by Flinders Petrie. He sent J.E. Quibell and F.W. Green to salvage finds from the sites in 1897. These early investigations focused primarily on the early dynastic funerary enclosures. They uncovered a large number of towns, tombs and artifacts from the pre-dynastic period. It wasn¡¯t until 1908 that archaeologists began to excavate the domestic portions of the area. The domestic archaeology was continued through the 1920¡¯s and 1930¡¯s by Guy Brunton.[NEWLINE]    Research continues at Hierakonpolis today, exploring the more domestic aspects of the area. Field schools have been run during the past decade which have excavated an elite cemetery, a temple, a funerary enclosure, domestic dwellings, and most recently a brewery. The current excavation puts all of their work online, and you can follow along with their progress at www.archaeology.org/interactive/hierakonpolis." 
local OKStr25 = "Dashur[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    The site of Dsahur is south of Giza on the west bank of the Nile. The site contains two of the four pyramids of Seneferu, the first king of the 4th dynasty. The most well known of these two is the Bent pyramid, originally titled as ¡°the Southern Pyramid Seneferu Gleams¡±. The site was first surveyed by Richard Pococke in 1743, and later in the 1750¡¯s by Robert Wood, James Dawkins and Giovanni Borra. The first clean up of the site was done by J.S. Perring in 1839. The first report of the dimensions and details of the site were done by Maragioglio and Rinaldi in 1961.[NEWLINE]    The pyramid is unique given its shape and preservation of the outer casing. Archaeologists believe the pyramid was planned to have a slope of 60 degrees until it reached 34 meters. Cracking in the structure led to the designers to expand the base of the pyramid and change the slope to 43.31 degrees. Further cracking after 49 meters high led to the builders shifting the rest of the pyramid to 43.21 degrees. While the pyramid has all of the features of a mortuary pyramid, including the funeral causeway, the monumental stelae, and altars, it does not contain the sarcophagus of Seneferu."
local FIStr25 = "Ain Asil[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    The site of Ain Asil is an urban settlement located near the eastern entrance to the Dakhla Oasis. The site was first uncovered as a result of strong sandstorms in 1947. It was discovered by Ahmed Fakhry who drew a correlation between the urban site and a nearby necropolis. Later excavations were done between 1968 and 1972. Since 1977 the site has been investigated by a team from the French Institute of Oriental Archaeology under the direction of Georges Soukiassian.[NEWLINE]    Investigations began by looking at the remains of a fortress and an administrative center which were the earliest portions fo the site. A number of dwellings, bakeries, and workshops have also been uncovered. While the town was originally constructed during the end of the Old Kingdom, it burned down and was replaced in the First intermediate period.  The site also had a nearby cemetery for the First Intermediate period. The burials consist of simple oval chambers, rock cut tombs and larger chambers underneath small mud brick mastabas. The provisions for the bodies during this period was fairly sparse. In comparison to earlier tombs, the ones from this period are more economical and fairly diminshed."
local MKStr25 = "Serabit el-Khadem (Hathor¡¯s Temple)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Serabit el-Khadem is located in the south-west Sinai Penninsula, and was a mining site during the Middle and New Kingdom for the extraction of turquoise. In addition to the mine itself, the site features a temple dedicated to Hathor, the ¡°Mistress of Turquoise¡±. The first excavations were carried out by Flinders Petrie from 1904-1905. His survey consisted primarily of description of the mine and temple, noting dimensions, materials, and primary figures in the inscriptions. Petrie interpreted the use of Hathor as beneficial foreign influence on the Egyptians, aiding in his diffusion based theories. The site has a high number of other types of shrines. Most are dedicated to Hathor or Ptah, and meant to improve the luck of the miners in finding turquoise or copper. Archaeological expeditions continued throughout the mid 20th century and until recently."
local SIStr25 = "Dra'Abuel-Naga (Theban King Necropolis)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    The Theban necropolis of Dra¡¯ Abu el-Naga is found north of the Valley of the Kings. The site consists of a wadi leading to the 17th dynasty tombs, and a number of natural wadis and hills. A number of early surveys and excavations were conducted in the 19th century by Mariette, Passalaqua and Petrie, as well as later digs by Carter and Carnarvon. The tombs found belong to many of the 17th dynasty rulers, including Kamose.[NEWLINE]    More recent excavations were undertaken by the German Archaeological Institution in order to create a comprehensive survey of the necropolis. The area in general had a wide rane of uses from the Middle Kingdom to Coptic period. However, it was only used as a site for royalty when the capital was at Thebes during the Second intermediate period. The German excavation focused on these royal tomb complexes, primarily with the goal of mapping and clarifying earlier work. They have been doing 3D reconstructions and have come to the conclusion that many of the funerary complexes would have had mud-brick pyramids. Evidence of the bricks is absent, but the cap of the pyramid, called the pyramidion has been found at the burial site of nub-Kherper-Re Intef."
local NKStr25 = "King Tut (Howard Carter)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    King Tut (1333 to 1323 BCE) is the most well known pharaoh; not because of his life or achievements, but because of the excavation of his tomb. KV62 is the designation of the tomb from the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter underneath the remains of a workers village from the Ramesside period. While the tomb had been robbed in antiquity, it was more complete than any others that had been discovered. This, combined with Carter¡¯s meticulous notes, gave archaeologists a more clear picture of the Egyptian funerary complex. The tomb conists of an entrance corridor, an antechamber, the burial chamber, the treasury and the annex. His sarcophagus was constructed of granite, and within this there were three mummiformed coffins, with the innermost composed of solid gold. His tomb was rather small in comparison with those of other pharaohs, but this is attributed to his sudden death and youth.[NEWLINE]    The excavation also became famous because of the many myths and theories that surrounded it. King Tut¡¯s mummy was thought to have been cursed, forecasting death for anyone who dared open his tomb. The rumor was perpetuated by the untimely death of Lord Carnarvon in 1923. There was also debate over whether the king¡¯s tomb was meant for him or someone else. The tomb is much less grand than would be expected, the sarcophagus was refitted for him, and some of the pictures do not seem to accurately represent him. Finally, since his discovery there has been debate about the manner in which he died, including theories on disease, murder, or a broken leg."

local PDStr50 = "Merimde Beni-Salame[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Located on the western border of the Nile, Merimde Beni-Salame is a prehistoric site including a Neolithic settlement and cemetery. The location of the site, and the constant flooding gave the stratigraphy a black color, which is why it was given the name Merimde, meaning ¡°the place of the ashes¡±. The site was first excavated in 1928 by Hermann Junker, who believed that it was uninhabited in prehistory and only contained scattered remains.  His work was never published, and all of the findings were given to different museums.[NEWLINE]    From 1977 to 1982, excavations at the site were resumed by the German institute of Archaeology in Cairo. These excavations found a number of small round wattle and reed huts. Activity patterns discerned from the placement of artifacts and features shows that huts were used both for habitation and storage, but that activity like cooking, lithic creation and grinding took place in the space in between the huts. Burials were found within the main portion of the site, not a separate cemetery. There are few grave goods found at the site, although many did include decorative mussel shells. The site was only used for Neolithic activity, dating to the 5th millennium BCE, although some evidence of Ma¡¯adi occupation is found five centuries after the abandonment of the site by the original Merimde inhabitants."
local OKStr50 = "Step Pyramid[NEWLINE]Abusir[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Abusir is the smallest region within the pyramid fields extending from Giza to Saqqara, and served as the royal necropolis during the fifth dynasty. There are a total of 14 pyramids, 11 tombs of lower officials, and two mastabas. These monuments have been highly looted over the years, and some were damaged during the 2011 protests in Egypt. Since 1989 excavations have been ongoing in Abusir South under the Czech Institute of Egyptology. They are focusing on the role of officials and priests  in the kingdom.[NEWLINE]    It also consists of an administrative center and two temples from the fifth dynasty. The temple of Niuserre was excavated from 1898 to 1901 by L. Borchardt and H. Schafer for the Royal Museums of Berlin. They did an extensive survey of the temple, mapping out the architecture and surrounding area. Later, in the 1920¡¯s, the inscriptions and papyri found at the site were interpreted by Bissing and Kees. These translations were used to better understand sed festivals. The second temple, dedicated to Userkaf, was excavated in the 1960¡¯s by Ricke and Edel. It was here that the Abusir Papyri were found in the late nineteenth century from illegal looting, and again in the late twentieth century during excavations by Czech archaeologist. The manuscripts document the life of the administrative center for the fifth dynasty. "
local FIStr50 = "Ehnasya el-Medina[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    This is the site of ancient Herakleopolis, which was the capital of the 20th nome. It is from here that dynasties IX and X originated from in the First Intermediate period. A number of excavations took place here during the 1960¡¯s and 1970¡¯s by the Archaeological Spanish Mission in Egypt. The necropolis which was found in 1968 dates to the First Intermediate period. The information from the cemetery is important in this region because there is a lack of domestic evidence. More recently, a number of architectural remains were found including a vareity of burned false doors. The necropolis was where the rulers of the IX and X dynasties were buried during the period of conflict with the Theban confederate. The tombs have also revealed a number of texts similar to the Coffin and Pyramid texts. The site would later be used in the New Kingdom as a workers village for the 18th dynasty rulers."
local MKStr50 = "el-Lisht[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    El-Lisht is located in Lower Egypt on the west bank of the Nile. Located near to this modern day village is the pyramid complex of Middle Kingdom pharaohs Amenemhat I and Senusret I from the 12th dynasty. The pyramids are built in the style of the late Old Kingdom. Each pyramid has a temple, a causeway leading to it, a chapel, and false doors to prevent grave robbing. Limestone for constructing the pyramids were taken from other Old Kingdom pyramids and still retain reliefs from these earlier kings. Only Senusret¡¯s has a nearby queen¡¯s pyramid, although the absence at Amenemhat I may be due to destruction.[NEWLINE]    The pyramid complex was first and unsuccessfully excavated by Gaston Maspero in 1883. He was unable to open the blocked entrances to the two pyramid. The first true excavation was conducted by Joseph-Etienne Gautier and Gustave Jequier in 1894 for the French Institute of Archaeology. During their dig they recovered a number of statues which currently reside in the Cairo Museum. The most thorough excavation was conducted in 1906 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art under Albert Lythgoe and Ambrose Lansing, continuing until 1934. Work was resumed by the Metropolitan Museum in 1984. They were able to record and recover the complex in great detail, and uncovered a vizier¡¯s chapel."
local SIStr50 = "Avaris[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Avaris was the capital of Egypt while it was under Hyksos rule from the 13th to 18th dynasties. The site is located at the Northeastern juncture of the Nile Delta. The earliest excavations were started by Edouard Naville in 1885 around the area, but the exact site was connected with Avaris. Later in the late 19th century, Petrie searched for the city of Avaris. He excavated a stronghold site which he argued was Avaris based on the hints at its location from a variety of Egyptian and Biblical texts. Monter argued in 1957 that Avaris was located at Tanis.[NEWLINE]    It wasn¡¯t until the 1970¡¯s that the actual site was confirmed as being the location of Avaris by the Austrian Archaeology Institute. They used ground penetrating radar to identify the city and its extent. From radar they were able to detect the outlines of streets, houses, and workshops. Little is known about the Hyksos invaders, so the information that will be gleaned from this site is important to our interpretations of the past."
local NKStr50 = "Deir el-Bahri, Hatshepsut¡¯s Palace[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Deir el-Bahri is a complex of mortuary temples belonging to Hatshepsut during the 18th dynasty. It is located on the west bank of the Nile, opposite of Luxor. The primary site belongs to Hatshepsut, called Djeser-Djeseru- the Holy of Holies. The walls of the temple illustrate her life as a pharaoh, including stories of her voyage to Punt. Both Thutmose III and Akhnaten damaged the temple after her death in an effort to remove her name.  Excavation at Deir el-Bahri was begun in 1881 by Gaston Maspero, the director of the Eyptian Antiquities Service. Inventory was made of the palace in order to prevent further tomb robbing. Excavations during the 1890¡¯s revealed more of the temple, and were led by French archaeologist Eduoard Naville. Restoration of the temple began in 1911 by Herbert Winlock.[NEWLINE]    Hatshepsut was famous for being one of the most well known female pharaohs. She was most well remembered for her excursions into Punt to open trading routes and create an alliance with the Queen of Punt. She opened up many of the trade routes that had been shut down by the Hyksos. She reigned as co-regent from 1479 to 1458 BCE, but was generally recognized to have assumed the position of pharaoh. After reigning for 22 years, she died of bone cancer. She was replaced by her nephew Thutmose III. Her tomb was found in the Valley of the Kings connected with the tomb of her father, Thutmose I."
--75 Turn
local PDStr75 = "el-Badari District[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    The el-Badari district consists of a number of pre-dynastic sites on the east bank of the Nile. It is a significant area because it is the earliest evidence of agriculture in Egypt. Guy Brunton in the 1920¡¯s and 1930¡¯s excavated over 100 sites from the pre-dyanstic period in this area. The first domestic village was excavated during this period by Caton Thompson. The area is recognized by a unique type of pottery Brunton identified. This rippled and combed pottery was called Badarian and defines this region and period. Graves were found throughout the site, and consisted of shallow oval burials with the individual in a contracted position lying on their left side with few grave goods.[NEWLINE]    From 1989 to 1992, Diane Holmes and the Institute of Archaeology from University College of London continued upon the work done previously. The primary types of materials found are potsherds and lithic fragments within a stratigraphy of ash, charcoal, vegetable matter and animal bone. These later excavations confirmed a continuous occupation at the site throughout the pre-dynastic period with a noticeable change from Badarian to Naqada II pottery, with transitional pieces found. Following the Naqada II period the area was used only for a burials, and only a single dynastic site, a temple, was found in the area."
local OKStr75 = "Abydos[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Abydos lies South of Cairo in Upper Egypt on the West bank of the Nile. Since the pre-dynastic period Abydos has been a major ceremonial center in Egypt as a burial ground for royal and private individuals. During the Old Kingdom, Abydos was the site for a non-royal burial ground known as the ¡®Middle Cemetery¡¯. The site was first investigated by August Mariette in the 1860¡¯s under the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. He primarily noted the inscriptions on the graves of sixth dynasty officials, most importantly the auto-biography of Weni the Elder. Later excavations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the British excavated the graves themselves in a different portion of the cemetery.[NEWLINE]    Most recently, the University of Michigan began comprehensive excavations of the Middle Cemetery in Abydos. They excavated a number of elite tombs, mastabas and cemetery structures from the Old Kingdom. Excavations are continuing in order to determine the extent of the cemetery, as well as better understand the transition into the First Intermediate period. A large number of ceramics and wooden statues have been found, as well as numerous burials. The goal of the project is to understand the change in burial patterns and activity during the entire range of occupation at Abydos, although current activity focuses on these main Old Kingdom sites."
local FIStr75 = "Burials at Naga ed-Deir[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    The site of Naga ed-Deir is located on the east bank of the Nile near Abydos in Upper Egypt. The cemetery is important for its almost unbroken sequence of cemetery use from the predynastic to the present. The first research done at the site was undertaken by the Hearst Egyptian Expedition of the University of California from 1901 to 1904. It was led by George Reisner. Later expeditions in 1912, 1913 and 1923  continued this work moving north through the cemetery.  The First Intermediate section of the cemetery was important due to a high number of stelae and introduction of funerary masks. The burials found were either rock cut tombs or mastabas, and were decorated with painted and carved reliefs. The dead were placed in wooden painted coffins, fully extended with the head facing to the north. It was during this period that plaster funerary masks were used for the first time.[NEWLINE]    From the First Intermediate section a large number of stelae were recovered, revealing details about life during the period.  The stela of Inheretnakht shows the development of new styles of representation, a diversion from the traditional Old Kingdom style. There was a shift to more provincial styles. This diversity of artwork shows the change in power from a central government to nomarchs. There were also a high number of wooden models that would have served as substitute servants for the afterlife. Every tomb had a large number of these models, as well as some personal accessories that showed their royal status."
local MKStr75 = "Hawara[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Hawara is located in Upper Egypt, and contains the pyramid complex of 12th dynasty king Amenemhat III and Princess Neferuptah. It also contains a cemetery dating from the Late Middle Kingdom to the Roman period. The funerary complex of Amenemhat III is the most elaborate and extensive of the Middle Kingdom, and is strongly influenced the Old Kingdom. The complex consists of a mud-brick pyramid with an outer casing of limestone. Within the pyramid there were a number of innovations such as sliding portcullises to block off corridors, and a different floor plan to increase protection. The tomb of the princess however was badly damaged, but the burial chamber below ground was still intact, including her sarcophagus.[NEWLINE]    Excavations at the site were primarily done in 1888 by Flinders Petrie. The site was highly damaged by stone robbing, and descriptions of the pyramid from Roman historians wasn¡¯t enough to reconstruct it. Petrie was able to recover a number of papyri from the Old Kingdom, and 146 portraits from Roman coffins, but little of the Middle Kingdom site. The tomb of Neferuptah was excavated in 1956 by Farang and Iskander. They were able to recover the princesses¡¯s sarcophagus and funerary equipment, although it had been damaged by ground water."
local SIStr75 = "Tell el-Maskhuta[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Tell el-Maskhuta is located on the eastern Nile delta. The site was occupied primarily during the Second Intermediate period, but its name during this period is unknown. The site was a short lived Hyksos outpost, and an unfortified village site. It is fairly similar in design to Avaris, and is characterized by dense households with features associated to agriculture, animal husbandry and cooking. Evidence of the use of horses was found at this site, as well as leather processing. The nearby cemetery contains a number of warriors tombs marked by the presence of an Asiatic ax and rich ornamental offerings.[NEWLINE]    The site was first excavated in 1883 by Eduoard Naville for the Egypt Exploration Society. He was able to map the site, as well as recover a number of inscriptions. The research was continued by Jean Cledat for the Antiquities Service, and he recovered a number of artifacts for the museum. Recently excavations have continued under the Egyptian Antiquities Organization of the northern cemetery and temple precincts."
local NKStr75 = "Glass Making Workshop of Piramesses[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Piramesses was the capital of Egypt during the 19th Dynasty reign of Ramesses II, also known as Ramses the Great. At this site was found the strongest evidence for the production of glass in Ancient Egypt, a glass workshop dating between 1250 and 1200 BC. The site was first found in the 19th century by Mahmoud Hamza. Since 1984, excavations have been carried out by Edgar B. Pusch, a German archaeologist. They have found remains of temples, worker¡¯s houses, horse stables, and specialist workshops for making arms and chariots. The site has primarily been analyzed on the basis of ground penetrating radar, which shows the overall organization of the site.[NEWLINE]    Most importantly, they found evidence of a glass making workshop. The evidence for this consists primarily of artifacts which are used in the production of glass, since no glass products have been found to date at the site. The workshop has evidence the early steps of the process of glass vessel casting as evidenced by the presence of molds and raw materials. There is also evidence of the sand and lime required for production, crucible for shaping the glass, and ingots of varying colors. The ingots could have been used to make polychrome glass vessels, faience, and glass slips of clear, red, cobalt blue and a transparent purple color."
--100 Turn
local PDStr100 = "El Amra (Amratian)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    This site is a Nagada I culture site, found west of the Nile and south of Abydos. The site is most well known for its first excavation in 1900 by D. Randall-MacIver and A. Wilkin. They found six hundred burials ranging from 4000 to 2890 BCE, and this site remains the largest pre-dynastic cemetery in Abydos. This site was important because of the continuity of the use of the site as a cemetery throughout a long period of time. The progression of tomb development can be seen at the site, from simple pot-burials to small brick chambers.[NEWLINE]    More recently in 2007, exacavations were conducted by the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilization at the University of Pennsylvania. Their field work focused on a domestic settlement near to the famous cemeteries which dates from the Nagada 1 to III period. The findings from this site are mainly potsherds, but there are interesting patterns to them. The types found at the site suggest that not only were the Amratians trading widely among other Egyptians, but were also trading with the Middle East. Future investigations plan to look more at the actual settlement and types of households found within it."
local OKStr100 = "Ras Budran[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    The site of Ras Budran is an Old Kingdom fort located on the west coast of the South Sinai peninsula. It was built during the 5th and 6th dynasties to serve as a military outpost to protect the mines against the Bedouin tribes. The circular fort made of limestone, measuring 44 meters in diameter. The fort was thought to house between 30 and 50 soldiers. Built during the reign of Pepi, their duty was to protect the turquoise and copper mines in the west coast. Excavation was done by Gregory Mumford from University of Toronto in 2005.  The location of the fort, 250 km from Egypt¡¯s main land suggests an increasingly desperate trading and military strategy in the waning days of the Old Kingdom. The inhabitants made Egyptian-style pots from local clay and were involved with maintaining trade."
local FIStr100 = "el-Tarif[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    The site of el-Tarif is located on the west bank of the Nile near Thebes. It contains a number of saff tombs which were developed only in Thebes during the First Intermediate period. Like earlier tombs, these have a large court with small interior rooms. The saff tomb has single or double rows of rock cut columns. There are approximately 300 to 400 saff tombs. The royal tombs were found underneath the courtyards located beyond large vertical shafts. They were buried within stone sarcophagi. There was little decoration, but stelae have been found within them.[NEWLINE]    The site has never been fully systematically excavated or surveyed. The first surveys were done by Auguste Mariette, Gaston Maspero and Georges Daressy in 1860 to 1889. Flinders Petrie excavated a number of smaller tombs between 1908 to 1909. The only systematic excavation was conducted by Dieter Arnold from 1966 to 1974. Only one tomb has been identified as Wahankh Intef II. No other rulers have been identified. Little is known about the individuals who were buried due to a lack of decoration and burial goods."
local MKStr100 = "Abydos Northern Cemetery[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Abydos lies South of Cairo in Upper Egypt on the West bank of the Nile. Since the pre-dynastic period Abydos has been a major ceremonial center in Egypt as a burial ground for royal and private individuals. During the Middle Kingdom the Northern cemetery was the principle burial ground for local elites, as well as members of the middle and lower classes. The earlier burial ground were still maintained as sacred spaces. Excavation in this cemetery began in 1858 by Mariette, d¡¯Athanasi and Anastasi. Following this, Petrie began more systematic excavations in 1899. Until the 1960¡¯s there was no widespread maps made, and artifacts were rarely attributed to location within the site.[NEWLINE]    In 1966, the Pennsylvania-Yale Expedition began to create more comprehensive records and maps for the Northern cemetery. This included a complete record of all human remains with health and demographic information. There were two types of graves found at the site reflecting economic and social status: shaft graves and surface graves. Shaft graves occur in groups and often have multiple chambers reflecting family use over time. Chambers held individuals found in simple wood coffins with some personal grave goods like jewelry, cosmetics and pottery. Surface graves were shallow pits, with individuals buried in either coffins or shrouds. The range of grave goods associated with these burials is equal to, if not more than the shaft graves. There is an underrepresentation of children and infants at the cemetery, and long term plundering has made reconstruction difficult."
local SIStr100 = "Wadi Tumilat[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    The site of Wadi Tumilat is located on the eastern Nile delta nearby Tell el-Maskhuta and Retabah. The location was intensively occupied during the Second Intermediate period as an agricultural area. The Hyksos cultivated this area during their rule evidenced by a high number of artifacts in the middle of the Wadi as well as domestic and funerary evidence from neighboring settlements. The site was more famously excavated in order to confirm biblical stories which argue this may be the site of Pithom, from the book Exodus.[NEWLINE]    The first complete survey of the Wadi was conducted by the German Institute in Cairo in 1930. In 1977 more thorough investigations began by Abed el-Haq and the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, finding a number of Hyksos tombs. Also in 1977, John S. Holladay from the University of Toronto began a major survey to establish a strong timeline for the site. They were able to map the neighboring Tells to the various time periods and create a timeline of occupation."
local NKStr100 = "Deir el-Medina (Workman¡¯s village)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]    Deir el-Medina is a workman¡¯s village located next to the Valley of the Kings, on the west bank of the Nile across from Luxor. It was inhabited during the 18th to 20th centuries, and housed the workers and families for the construction of funerary relics and tombs for kings and royalty. The first excavation was done by Ernesto Schiaparelli from 1905 to 1909, primarily looking for papyri and ceramics. Later, a French team led by Bernard Bruyere excavated the entire site from 1922 to 1951. They thoroughly studied the village, dump site, and cemetery. The site continued to be studied by Jaroslav Cerny from 1951 to 1970. To this day this site has revealed the most thoroughly documented remains of what domestic community life was like in Ancient Egypt.[NEWLINE]    The site contains 68 houses with a single main road leading through it. Buildings were constructed of mud brick lying over stone foundations. Each house contained four to five rooms, with the main room used as a shrine, a kitchen with a cellar, two smaller rooms for sleeping, and an entrance room. All houses contained niches in the walls which would have held statues and acted as altars. Tombs and chapels were cut from rock and used by the community. The village was used from the reign of Thutmosis I to Ramesses XI, abandoned due to Libyan raids and instability. A number of historical texts survive from the village, further revealing what daily life was like. They document the types of labor in the village, administration, and organization. In general, the village was comprised of middle class workers, who were salaried employees of the government."
