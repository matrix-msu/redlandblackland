From the Stela of Amenhotep II from the New Kingdom.[NEWLINE]Archery is one of the earliest forms of weaponry in Egypt, with improvements made throughout the periods. The oldest bows were single curves of wood strung with sinew, with double curves introduced in the late Pre-dynastic, and composite bows used in the New Kingdom. Arrowheads were originally made of flint, with the transition to Bronze in the Middle Kingdom and Iron in the New Kingdom."/>

The boats were constructed of primarily of cedar, although smaller boats were made of reeds and papyrus. Artwork and models show the importance of boats throughout Egyptian history.

From Herodotus' Histories[NEWLINE]Egypt had two primary calendars: lunar and civil, with each serving drastically different purposes. The civil calendar was based on the seasons and the flooding of the Nile. A year was measured by the length of time between inundations. The more precise calendar was the lunar calendar used for religious purposes. This was based on observations of the stages of the moon. The year was divided into 354 days and a twelve month lunar cycle. These were split into three agricultural seasons."/>

From the Instruction in Letter Writing Papyrus from Lansing, New Kingdom.[NEWLINE]The Egyptian language is part of the Afroasiatic tradition where roots of words are extremely important and there are distinguishing genders. The use of hieroglyphs began around 3000 BCE, and went through considerable change over time. At first pictures directly represented words, but this shifted to pictures representing sounds. Egyptian hieroglyphics were translated with the finding of the Rosetta stone in 1822, although it took time to fully decipher the language."/>

Egyptians were the first to design wheels using spokes instead of a solid piece. Birch was used to create the axle and wheel, with the pole made of willow and the spokes of plum.

The resulting material is harder and tougher than either of the original metals and it is easier to melt and cast (e.g., pour into molds to make spear tips and other useful items).

A stela from the Second Intermediate period discusses Amenhotep II's love for horses, and the earliest representations of horses come from the tomb of Ahmose at the end of the second intermediate.
